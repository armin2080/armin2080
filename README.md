I'm a Computer Science Student and Python Programmer 💻

I love solving problems and thinking outside the box, always motivated by a sense of purpose and the thrill of tackling challenges. I have a strong foundation in Python, MySQL, Postgres, Django Web Framework, Data Analytics, etc. My experience includes working as a Backend Developer, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Researcher.

I'm an explorer of new tech, an avid learner, and a natural problem-solver. When I'm not in code, you'll find me watching tech-related YouTube videos, fueling my curiosity. Alongside my tech passion, I'm also an accomplished pianist. 😎🎹

Feel free to contact me on Telegram to talk about tech or music.👐

### Talking about Personal Stuff:

- 🛠 &nbsp; I’m currently working with Python(Django, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)
- 🚀 &nbsp; I’m currently exploring Machine Learning and AI
- 📫 &nbsp; Reach me out: arminmaddah.a@gmail.com.

Python is not just a programming language; it's filled with Easter eggs. For example, try ```python
import this
``` in your Python interpreter for some hidden wisdom.
